# Smart Weather App üå§

This project will show you the weather of any city from around the globe. You just have to enter the name of the city you want to get the exact weather conditions from and press Enter.
You won‚Äôt even have to look out the window as the app will make you feel like you are already outside!

Weather is sometimes difficult to predict. This accurate weather app allows to find out a detailed forecast wherever you are, for any time of the day by tapping on the icons:
- Current and ‚ÄúFeels like‚Äù temperature
- Min and Max temperature
- Pressure, wind speed and humidity information
